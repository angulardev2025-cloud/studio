    "description": "In this video,  we analyze three fundamentally strong stocks that have recently delivered significant technical breakouts. We aim to determine if the underlying fundamentals and growth prospects truly reflect these breakouts, distinguishing between sustainable growth and a temporary rally.\n\nOur first company, a leading lifestyle and luxury brand, broke a two-year consolidation range to hit a new All-Time High (ATH). The business demonstrated robust Q2 FY26 performance with 29% YoY revenue growth and a 59% jump in Net Profit. However, we examine concerns surrounding high inventory and valuation.\n\nNext, a value-added dairy and nutrition company has completed a major multi-year breakout, ending consolidation that began in 2017. This firm achieved 59% YoY Net Profit growth and is aggressively aiming for a long-term ₹10,000 crore revenue target.\n\nFinally, we look at an IT services stock that defied sector pessimism, marking a new 52-week high breakout. This company showed broad-based growth, delivering 24% YoY revenue increase and 45% Net Profit growth, while completely eliminating its debt.\n\nWatch now for a deep dive into the technicals, financials, and future outlook of these three unique businesses! \n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@moneytalksbygroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@thrivebygroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date: 21-11-2025",

This episode explores power, politics, geopolitics, and the global shifts reshaping the 21st century.\n\nWe discuss geopolitics, society, and how India is evolving. Dr. Vikas Divyakirti talks about the cultural differences between Delhi and Mumbai, why Mumbai feels more open and professional, while Delhi has a stronger political tone. He explains why making a mistake and admitting it openly matters, especially in political spaces. We also discuss how India is moving between left and right ideologies, and how a convergence is slowly forming.\n\nWe also touch upon global power, leadership, and education. Russia and America have enough nuclear power to destroy the world many times over. Trump’s unapologetic, business-first approach reflects a different mindset of leadership. Dr. Vikas discusses how teacher salaries in India are far lower than in countries like the US and UK, affecting both quality and satisfaction in education. If you’re curious about world affairs, political psychology, or India’s geopolitical standing, this is one of the most important conversations you’ll hear.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations! \n\nFollow Dr. Vikas Divyakirti Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/divyakirti.vikas\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

He gives us details of how he fought instinct when he first saw Kasab: “Kasab ko dekhte hi mann hua maar doon!” and why he stopped himself, knowing that Kasab was India’s only chance to expose the terror network. From the legendary handshake between Haji Mastan and Karim Lala, to the 51 Mumbai blasts mastermind Zaleesh Ansari, to the real reason Dawood fled Mumbai, Maria breaks down the psychology, politics, and power that shaped India’s crime world. \n\nHe also issues a chilling warning, “Lawrence Bishnoi is the new Dawood!” as he explains how the modern mafia now runs on smartphones and social media instead of guns and goons.

In this episode, he tells us what actually happens in the first 72 hours when cancer begins forming in the body, why small recurring irritations matter, and how early signs like diarrhoea, constipation or constant discomfort often get ignored. He explains why cancer develops only when immunity drops and why preventive testing, including CBC, LFT, CA-125, CEA, thyroid and liver profiles, is crucial for catching it early.\n\nWe also explore his S.M.I.L.E. formula for building immunity: prioritising sleep, keeping the body in movement, choosing immunity-boosting foods, staying surrounded by love, and getting daily sunlight. Dr Krishna discusses the dangers of everyday habits, such as consuming burnt food, using aluminium cookware, drinking from plastic bottles, and exposing ourselves to chemicals in nail polish, toothpaste, and shampoos. \n\nIn the final part, he discusses how people can retrain their bodies after a cancer diagnosis through strong willpower, movement, meditation and emotional release. We talk about why young people today fall ill more often, the lessons from Blue Zones, the hidden toxins inside your pillow, the link between melatonin and cancer, and the role of spiritual health in healing.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations that could protect you and your loved ones.\n\nFollow Dr Tarang Krishna Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drtarangkrishna/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrTarangKrishna/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-tarang-krishna-64020a20/\n\nFollow Cancer Healer Centre Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cancerhealer/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/DrKrishnasCancerHealerCenter\n\n-----------\n\nTo Know More,\nFollow Raj Shamani On ⤵︎\n\nInstagram @RajShamani\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rajshamani/\n\nTwitter @RajShamani\nhttps://twitter.com/rajshamani\n\nFacebook @ShamaniRaj\nhttps://www.facebook.com/shamaniraj\n\nLinkedIn - Raj Shamani\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/rajshamani/\n\n•   •   •\n\n#podcast #figuringout #rajshamani #health #cancer #cancerhealer #food #relationship \n\nAbout Figuring Out\nFiguring Out Podcast is a Candid Conversations University where Raj Shamani brings raw conversations with the Top 1% in India.",

    "description": "Three fundamentally strong companies where Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have significantly increased their holdings in recent quarters. This confidence is notable given that FIIs collectively withdrew approximately ₹1.98 lakh crore from the Indian market in 2025.\n\nThe first company, a major manufacturer of wires, cables, and Fast Moving Electrical Goods (FMEG), achieved an 18% YoY revenue growth and a 56% increase in Net Profit in Q2 FY26. Key financials are strong, though the script highlights risks associated with high inventory and receivables, which strain the adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (CFO).\n\nThe second company, focused on batteries and electronics for sectors like defense and railways, saw exceptional performance driven by specific rail orders, leading to a 135% YoY revenue jump and 345% growth in Net Profit. However, a major challenge is the deterioration of cash conversion, with the CFO/PAT ratio falling sharply to 28% in H1 FY26.\n\nThe third company operates as a Contract Research, Development & Manufacturing Organization (CRDMO) for global pharma firms. It reported a 100% rise in Profit After Tax (PAT) on 36% revenue growth. Despite aggressive investment plans and having cleared long-term debt, this company also faces tighter liquidity as its CFO/PAT ratio has dropped due to growing trade receivables.\nThe overall discussion emphasizes that while institutional buying signals confidence, thorough research into underlying fundamentals and cash flow is equally important.\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date:17-11-2025",

In this episode, we talk about how perception shapes our entire life. Dr. Vikas Divyakirti explains how people often see him as “too serious,” while in reality, he’s fun, active in sports, and very different from the image created around him. He says society keeps telling us to be “ideal” , good at dance, sports, grooming, and understanding people but trying to be ideal only makes life harder. It’s much better to simply be a comfortable and real human being.\n\nWe also discuss self-esteem and how many of us feel shy to ask for help because of an unconscious fear of “kya chukaana padega?” Some people struggle to say no easily, and that can become a lifelong burden. Vikas talks about how being known publicly means even small issues get highlighted like when CCPA fined many institutions but the spotlight came only on him.\n\nThe episode then moves into relationships, evolution, and loneliness. How men and women choose partners is mostly driven by evolutionary psychology, not logic. Most relationships run on cost-benefit analysis, and marriage may reduce in the future. We talk about why people cheat because of the clash between our genes that push us to seek variety and a society that demands monogamy and “sanskaar.” The conversation ends with loneliness, modern emotional needs, and how humans today struggle between biology and expectations.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Dr. Vikas Divyakirti Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/divyakirti.vikas\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

From protein deficiency to sugar addiction, salt myths, meal sequencing, gut health, thrifty genes, sleep, and even travel constipation, Pooja simplifies everything with powerful analogies and practical fixes.\n\nThis is the episode you send to every Indian who thinks “one bowl of dal is enough” or believes “poha is healthy because it’s light.” Pooja reveals why 73% of India is protein deficient, why we’re eating naked carbs, how to use fibre and protein to ‘dress’ your carbs, and the exact order in which you should eat your meals to cut glucose spikes.\n\nShe also explains hidden reasons behind sugar cravings, the role of salt, why sugar is 8× more addictive than cocaine, the importance of hydration and minerals, and how sleep deprivation derails your fat metabolism. We also talk about India's genetic makeup, why we have the “storer” body type, why we’re prone to diabetes, and how our classic Indian thali is still one of the best-designed meals in the world. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations! \n\nFollow Pooja Makhija here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/poojamakhija/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "description": "Why are some companies seeing double-digit profit growth while their stock prices plummet?\n\n This video dives deep into the financials of three high-growth stocks that have seen their share prices fall by more than 30% from their 52-week highs.\n\nThese businesses boast remarkable 3-year performance metrics, with Sales CAGR reaching up to 79% and Profit CAGR reaching up to 98%.\n\nWe analyze the reasons behind this disconnect:\n\n1. The Infrastructure Play: A real estate company aggressively expanding into the high-growth data center and cloud services sector, projecting massive future revenue from this new diversification.\n\n2. The Turnaround Story: An integrated wind energy solutions provider that recently flipped its financials from massive losses to strong profitability, driven by backward integration and strong execution in its core products.\n\n3. The Renewables Specialist: A turnkey wind power developer leveraging a massive 2+ GW order book and increasing its annuity-based revenue, but managing risks like revenue concentration.\nIs this price correction purely due to market sentiment, or are fundamental challenges—such as aggressive valuations, working capital management, or execution delays—coming into play? Watch the full breakdown to determine which of these companies truly aligns growth and long-term value!\n\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date: 10-11-2025",

Karan has spent decades advising some of the country’s wealthiest individuals. From managing ₹1 crore to ₹1000 crore, he breaks down how objectives change, why psychological and emotional security often outweigh financial gains, and what truly keeps India’s rich awake at night.\n\nWe talk about the biggest fears of the wealthy: not losing money, but losing values. He explains how families worry about passing on humility and responsibility to their children, the rising expectations from the next generation, and how social media has made comparison and peer pressure sharper than ever. He also opens up about the “fear of insignificance,” especially among those who’ve already achieved material success.\n\nHe talks about old money vs new money, city-wise mindsets, and the psychology of risk, and why he thinks India's next wave of innovation will come from inclusivity. He says the opportunity today isn’t just for the rich: “Middle India’s ambition and talent are exploding,” and that’s where the real story of growth lies. Karan offers a rare inside view of wealth and aspiration in modern India.\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Karan Bhagat here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/karanbhagatkk/\n\nFollow 360 ONE here:\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/360one/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/official360one/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "title": "3 healthcare stocks rapidly expanding their business capacities?",
    "description": "India's domestic healthcare industry is entering a massive growth phase, with the core healthcare delivery segment projected to reach ₹9.4–9.8 lakh crore by FY28. This rapid expansion is supported by factors like an aging population, rising lifestyle diseases, and medical tourism, which is expected to reach USD 58.2 billion by 2035.\n\nThis video features three prominent hospital chains that are leveraging this market momentum by planning to double their existing bed capacities.\n\nThe first company, a major player primarily located in Tier 1 cities, reports the industry’s highest occupancy rate (76% in Q1 FY26). They are funding their substantial capacity addition largely through internal accruals, aiming for a zero-debt approach to expansion. A second major multi-speciality provider, focused on North and East India, is driving growth through significant greenfield (new hospital) additions, reporting robust Q1 FY26 net profit growth of nearly 50%. Lastly, a Western India focused provider also targets doubling its bed count, supporting its growth strategy with a mix of internal cash and debt.\n\nWhile all three show strong revenue and profitability gains (driven by higher capacity utilisation and improved Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed), high market valuations across the sector suggest that investors must carefully assess how these ambitious expansion plans will translate into sustainable future profits.\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date: 31st october 2025",

He tells us how those early experiences shaped how he sees truth, failure, and success today.\n\nHe opens up about anger, rejection in love, and why he believes it’s better to be underconfident than overconfident. Nawaz also talks about how acting taught him to recognise lies, why people often hide their truths, and how speaking honestly has become a rare act in today’s world.\nIn the last segment, he reflects on the lowest phase of his career, what keeps him fearless now, and why he never asks for work.

    "description": "This video delves into three best momentum breakout stocks selected from the Nifty Midcap 100 index, following the index's own breakout after consolidating for more than a year. \n\nThe analysis focuses on determining whether the recent technical spikes are short-term anomalies or the start of genuine re-ratings based on momentum and fundamental strength.\n\nWe analyze companies across three distinct sectors: Renewable Energy Manufacturing, Oil Marketing/Refining, and Industrial Power Generation.\n\nOne company in the renewable sector has seen explosive three-year profit growth (191% CAGR), fueled by high import duties, government capacity allocations, and strategic acquisitions, leading to a massive expansion of operating margins (4% to 19%). Its future is supported by a large order book of around ₹47,000 crores.\n\nA second major energy player, which just broke out after 1.5 years of consolidation, showed a remarkable earnings rebound in H1 FY26 (Net Profit expanded 10x) due to improved cost management and record Gross Marketing Margins.\n\nThe third company, a manufacturer of engines, hit a new all-time high after tight consolidation, benefiting from secular tailwinds like the domestic power generation segment's robust growth, particularly demand from the burgeoning data center industry.\n\nThe video also discusses key risks for these companies, such as export uncertainties and US anti-dumping probes for the first company, and the inherent cyclicality and domestic under-recovery pressures affecting the energy marketer.\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date: 31st October 2025",

He also shares his views on love, the importance of female energy, and how in today’s times, even comedy has become risky.\n\nIn the last segment, we talk about his role as Chairman of NSD, his take on lobbying in awards, how AI will raise the bar for creativity, and his thoughts on politics and religion.
