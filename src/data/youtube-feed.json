From starting off in Delhi cricket clubs to becoming a key part of Team India for over a decade, Ishant has seen it all: the highs, the setbacks, and the lessons that shaped him both as a player and a person. This conversation captures his journey beyond just numbers on the scoreboard.\n\nWe talk about how he got into fast bowling, the challenges of breaking into the Indian team, and the dynamics inside the dressing room,  from Delhi vs Mumbai cricket culture to sledging battles with Australia. Ishant opens up about being banned for a test match, the differences he observed under Dhoni’s and Virat’s captaincy, and what makes bowlers like Bumrah so special. He also shares stories of over 30 runs conceded in a single over, the mental toll it took on him, and how he bounced back stronger.\n\nIn the last segment, Ishant reflects on young talent like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, and Mayank Yadav, his proudest wickets, and the mental acceptance of moving on from Test cricket. He also talks about his rituals before bowling, his views on favouritism in selections, and how trolls and self-doubt shaped his mindset. A candid and honest look into the life of one of India’s most reliable pacers.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Ishant Sharma here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ishant.sharma29/\nX: https://x.com/imishant\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "description": "3 strong stocks from the strongest sectors\n\n\nIn this video, we deep-dive into the performance, financials, and future outlook of three major players from these strong sectors that have recently broken out to their All-Time Highs.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\n• The Commercial Vehicle Manufacturer: We analyze a leading company specializing in commercial, light, and defense vehicles. Learn how cost optimization measures and a favorable product mix resulted in a 200 bps margin expansion, driving operating profit up by over 16% in Q1FY26. We also examine how the standalone entity became net debt-free by strategically investing surplus cash.\n\n• The Major Steel Producer: Discover how a global materials company achieved a spectacular net profit jump of over 154%. This growth was driven primarily by lower raw material costs (like coking coal) and a significant reduction in the effective tax rate. We also look at their massive long-term capex plans for capacity expansion.\n\n• The Integrated Healthcare Giant: Explore a healthcare ecosystem operator with over 10,100 beds and a strong focus on high-specialty areas like oncology and cardiology. The company reported a 26% jump in operating profit, supported by improved case mix, tariff hikes, and new targeted capacity additions. We also discuss their ambitious plan to add over 4,300 new beds.\nDon't miss this analysis on finding stocks with relative strength in outperforming sectors!

In this conversation, she shares the highs, lows, and everything that shaped her into the artist people adore today.\n\nWe talk about her humble beginnings, the loss of her mother at a young age, her father’s resistance to her singing, and how her passion slowly turned into acceptance and support. She opens up about how Navratri became such a big part of her identity, the challenges of performing live, and why she believes folk music continues to hold such a deep connection with people. Along the way, she also shares her love for Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle, her dream collaborations, and the insecurities she still carries despite decades of success.\n\nIn the last segment, Falguni reflects on the changes she’s seen in three decades of Navratri, her rituals before and after shows, her dream of owning an aircraft and a yacht, and how she truly wants to be remembered. She also talks about the simplicity of folk songs, her relationship with the Gujarati diaspora abroad, and why she has never planned her life but instead embraced whatever came her way.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Falguni Pathak Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/falgunipathak12/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@FalguniPathakNavratri\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business, content creation, & public speaking.

With decades of expertise in child development, he has worked closely with parents and schools to guide healthier ways of raising children. In this conversation, he breaks down what effective parenting truly means in today’s world and how early experiences shape a child’s future.\n\nWe explore the importance of tone and balance in parenting, why hitting or strict discipline doesn’t work, and how children learn more from engagement and interaction than from easy comfort. Dr. Dalwai explains the difference between nurture and nature, why reading stimulates the brain far more than screen time, and how disappointment plays a role in building resilience. He also shares insights on autism, why its prevalence has risen so drastically, and how autistic children often have exceptional pattern recognition abilities.\n\nIn the last segment, we dive into the challenges of today’s tech-driven and socially isolated world, the dangers of excessive screen time, and why community and human interaction are more important than ever for children. Dr. Dalwai also answers questions around inclusivity in schools, whether autism can be prevented before birth, and what parents can do to raise children better equipped for the future.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Dr. Samir Dalwai here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samyrdalwai\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/dr-samir-hasan-dalwai-b0302436\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "title": "These Facts about Nifty P/E ratio can help you invest better",
    "description": "Feeling the market jitters? It's normal This video  explains why Indian equity market dips are routine and happen almost every year. Learn that the Nifty 50 has typically seen a correction of at least 10% annually, with an average dip of about 15%.\n\nDiscover why these drawdowns, though painful, are temporary, with prior highs usually reclaimed within 7-12 months, once the market finds its bottom. We'll reveal the dramatic impact of trying to time the market—missing just a few of the best days can significantly reduce your returns, especially since many of these powerful recovery days often occur right after the worst downturns.\n\nUnderstand how long-term investing in Indian equities has historically delivered double-digit annualized returns, with positive outcomes becoming far more consistent over longer horizons.\n\nThis video offers a clear framework for navigating market volatility: learn to budget for discomfort, ring-fence your near-term cash, and use market signals as guides, not hard switches. Volatility is simply the price of admission; time in the market is where the real compounding happens.\n\nWatch to understand how to expect the dips, prepare for them, and stay invested through the discomfort to capture the powerful bursts that drive most of the returns in Indian equities.\n\n#IndianStockMarket #Nifty50 #StockMarketCorrections #InvestingInIndia #MarketMindset #LongTermInvesting \nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\nName of the Research Analyst - Cleyon Savio Dsouza\nName of the narrator - Aleena Rais\nReport Date: 15th September 2025",

In this conversation, he takes us behind the story of how the UAE transformed from deserts into one of the most futuristic hubs in the world, and what philosophies shaped that growth. We also explore the deep cultural, political, and economic links between India and the UAE.\n\nWe discuss Dubai’s rise in aviation with Emirates Airlines, the healthcare policies that are reshaping society, the real estate boom, and whether the hype around the UAE’s growth is sustainable. Dr. Alshaali also shares insights on how the UAE balances modern globalisation with its Islamic roots, why Indians continue to move to Dubai, and the unique governance structure of its seven emirates.\n\nIn the final segment, we talk about money-making opportunities in the UAE today, the Ministry of Possibilities, futuristic projects like cloud seeding, and the realities of life as an Emirati vs a non-Emirati. Dr. Alshaali even shares his thoughts on why people perceive every Emirati as rich, and what his own personal life looks like beyond the title of Ambassador.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Dr. Abdulnasser Alshaali Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/aj_alshaali\nX: https://x.com/aj_alshaali\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, “Dude, same!” \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that’s funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you’re laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you’re caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it’s a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends. Think of it as the fun table at the party, sunny, chatty, and just unhinged enough to keep you hooked.\n\n\nFollow us on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/primevideoin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PrimeVideoIN/\nX: https://x.com/PrimeVideoIN\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

Ruchir also shares his thoughts on world leaders like Putin and Trump, what emerging nations can learn from developed economies, and why the freebies culture may be holding India back. \n\nIn the last segment, we dive into India’s growth story, from competition between states and infrastructure spending to unemployment, opportunities for young talent, and lessons we can take from China.

    "description": "Prime Video India Presents\nTwo Much With Kajol And Twinkle Official Teaser\nStarring Kajol and Twinkle Khanna\nCreated by Banijay Asia\n\nOfficial Release Date September 25, 2025 on Prime Video India.\n\nAbout:\nKajol and Twinkle are serving up a talk show with a twist - equal parts masti, magic and maybe even some manic energy. Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, “Dude, same!” \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that’s funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you’re laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you’re caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it’s a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends. Think of it as the fun table at the party, sunny, chatty, and just unhinged enough to keep you hooked.\n\nFollow us on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/primevideoin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PrimeVideoIN/\nX: https://x.com/PrimeVideoIN\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

With his expertise in reading human behaviour, he explains how much our gestures, expressions, and even the smallest body cues reveal about us. From spotting hidden emotions to decoding lies, his work bridges psychology and crime investigation in fascinating ways.\n\nWe discuss how professional criminals try to use specific gestures to appear innocent, how microexpressions can expose when someone is hiding the truth, and whether body language can help identify dangerous people, including pedophiles. Gaurav also breaks down the everyday mistakes we make, things as small as avoiding eye contact, crossing arms at the wrong moment, or mismatching words and actions that instantly create dislike and distrust in others. \n\nIn the last segment, he shares the step-by-step process of detecting lies in high-stakes situations, the most difficult cases he’s had to decode, and what serial killers actually feel after their first crime. Gaurav explains the psychology of deception, the science behind spotting danger, and the subtle signals most people miss. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Gaurav Gill Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodylanguagewithgauravgill\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-gill-7241bb63/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "description": "Markets don’t stay the same.\nAt times equities rally, in other phases debt performs better, and during uncertainty, gold or silver take the lead. The challenge? No single asset class works across all market cycles.\n\nThat’s where a multi-asset approach can help. By combining equity, debt, gold, and silver within one portfolio — and adjusting allocations as markets change — investors can aim for better diversification and potentially better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nThe Groww Multi Asset Allocation Fund is built on this very idea. It also uses Groww Mutual Fund’s proprietary platform, SHAASTRA (Strategic Holistic Asset Allocation and Systematic Technical Risk Assessment), which supports fund managers with data-driven insights to make allocation decisions more structured and less prone to human biases.\n\n🗓️ NFO Period: 10th September 2025 – 24th September 2025\n\nExplore : https://groww.in/nfo/groww-multi-asset-allocation-fund-direct-growth\n\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations",

    "title": "Pehla Pyaar, Pehla Heartbreak 💔 | Akshay Kumar, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor",
    "description": "First love feels like discovering fire for the very first time. Everything burns brighter, every touch leaves an echo, every word feels sacred. You go to school just to see them smile in the hallway, and suddenly that smile is the most important sight in the world. You stay awake until sunrise because their voice feels better than sleep itself. Every song makes sense, every poem speaks your truth, every star in the sky seems less beautiful than they are. You’d choose them in this universe and in every universe that could ever exist. In their presence, time bends, pain disappears, and forever feels like something you can finally hold in your hands. You think this is it, the kind of love poets spent lifetimes chasing, the kind of love that could never be broken.\nBut then life happens. Distance grows where closeness once lived. Silence floods the places where laughter once echoed. The person who was once your entire world becomes a stranger you still dream about at night. The same memories that once made you smile now burn like open wounds that refuse to heal. You replay conversations in your head, wonder what you could have said, what you could have done differently. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be. Maybe the timing was cruel. Maybe the world was too heavy on two young hearts. And so, you’re left staring at your phone, almost typing their name, before remembering that they are no longer yours to reach.\nThe hardest part isn’t losing them. It’s learning how to exist without them. Waking up every day and remembering all over again that they are gone. Carrying a love that has nowhere to rest, like water slipping endlessly through your hands. Yet somehow, you keep breathing, you keep walking, you keep living with a heart that is shattered but still beating, broken but still full of hope. Because even after the fire fades, something inside you still aches to believe that beauty will return.\nSometimes, the love we cannot live without is the very love we must learn to survive without. ❤‍?\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

Watch the stand up comedy special Mood Kharaab available only on Prime Video India.\n\nWatch Now - https://bit.ly/BiswaMoodKharaabOnPrime\n \nAbout:\nBiswa Kalyan Rath is a stand up comedian who used to be angry at the world.

With years of experience in finance, Ajinkya shares practical insights on how to start investing, what mistakes to avoid, and how ordinary people can build wealth over time.\n\nWe explore questions most people have about money: how much you need before investing, whether to focus on active or passive income, and the differences between FDs, bonds, stocks, gold, and real estate. Ajinkya explains how banks pay interest, why sure-shot returns are a red flag, and what role emergency funds and insurance play. He also discusses India versus the US as investment destinations, financial advisory access for salaried individuals, and how to identify scams in the market.\n\nIn the last segment, he breaks down strategies for first-time investors, including where to put money across high, medium, and low-risk options, and shares advice for young professionals who want to double their income by upskilling. The conversation also explores whether a person from a low-income background in India can truly achieve financial independence, and how much wealth is required to achieve it. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Ajinkya Kulkarni Here:\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajinkyamkulkarni/\nX: https://x.com/ajinkyamkul/\n\nFollow Wint Wealth Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wintwealth\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wintwealth\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

Mumbai), an experienced dermatologist and cosmetologist who has worked extensively on skin health, treatments, and anti-aging solutions. She talks about India’s obsession with fairness, explains how dermatologists classify skin shades, and clears myths around tanning, marriage-related pressures, and what “fairness” really means in medical terms.\n\nWe discuss treatments like skin lightening, peeling, micro-needling, and the rising popularity of Korean skincare. Dr. Madhuri shares the real differences between creams, serums, and oils, why certain marketing trends like rice water toners or coffee scrubs aren’t always effective, and how good skincare habits can directly boost self-esteem. She also talks about anti-aging, collagen products, sunscreen myths, and common mistakes people make at different ages.\n\nTowards the end, she discusses trending ingredients like niacinamide and ceramides, how to layer actives safely, and the quick fixes celebrities often use.
