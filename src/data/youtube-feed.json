Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, ‚ÄúDude, same!‚Äù \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that‚Äôs funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you‚Äôre laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you‚Äôre caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it‚Äôs a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends.

Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, ‚ÄúDude, same!‚Äù \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that‚Äôs funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you‚Äôre laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you‚Äôre caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it‚Äôs a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends.

With his expertise in reading human behaviour, he explains how much our gestures, expressions, and even the smallest body cues reveal about us. From spotting hidden emotions to decoding lies, his work bridges psychology and crime investigation in fascinating ways.\n\nWe discuss how professional criminals try to use specific gestures to appear innocent, how microexpressions can expose when someone is hiding the truth, and whether body language can help identify dangerous people, including pedophiles. Gaurav also breaks down the everyday mistakes we make, things as small as avoiding eye contact, crossing arms at the wrong moment, or mismatching words and actions that instantly create dislike and distrust in others. \n\nIn the last segment, he shares the step-by-step process of detecting lies in high-stakes situations, the most difficult cases he‚Äôs had to decode, and what serial killers actually feel after their first crime. Gaurav explains the psychology of deception, the science behind spotting danger, and the subtle signals most people miss. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Gaurav Gill Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodylanguagewithgauravgill\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-gill-7241bb63/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

No single asset class works across all market cycles.\n\nThat‚Äôs where a multi-asset approach can help. By combining equity, debt, gold, and silver within one portfolio ‚Äî and adjusting allocations as markets change ‚Äî investors can aim for better diversification and potentially better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nThe Groww Multi Asset Allocation Fund is built on this very idea. It also uses Groww Mutual Fund‚Äôs proprietary platform, SHAASTRA (Strategic Holistic Asset Allocation and Systematic Technical Risk Assessment), which supports fund managers with data-driven insights to make allocation decisions more structured and less prone to human biases.\n\nüóìÔ∏è NFO Period: 10th September 2025 ‚Äì 24th September 2025\n\nExplore : https://groww.in/nfo/groww-multi-asset-allocation-fund-direct-growth\n\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India‚Äôs Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\nüëâ Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\nüëâ Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\nüëâ Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\nüëâ IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\nüëâ Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\nüëâ Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\nüëâ Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\nüëâ Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\nüëâ Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\nüîî Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\nüîî Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\nüîî Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\nüîî Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\nüîî Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\nüîî Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\nüîî Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\nüîî Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\nüîî Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\nüîî Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\nüîî Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\nüîî Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\nüîî Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\nüîî Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\nüîî Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\nüîî How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\nüîî Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations",

    "description": "First love feels like discovering fire for the very first time. Everything burns brighter, every touch leaves an echo, every word feels sacred. You go to school just to see them smile in the hallway, and suddenly that smile is the most important sight in the world. You stay awake until sunrise because their voice feels better than sleep itself. Every song makes sense, every poem speaks your truth, every star in the sky seems less beautiful than they are. You‚Äôd choose them in this universe and in every universe that could ever exist. In their presence, time bends, pain disappears, and forever feels like something you can finally hold in your hands. You think this is it, the kind of love poets spent lifetimes chasing, the kind of love that could never be broken.\nBut then life happens. Distance grows where closeness once lived. Silence floods the places where laughter once echoed. The person who was once your entire world becomes a stranger you still dream about at night. The same memories that once made you smile now burn like open wounds that refuse to heal. You replay conversations in your head, wonder what you could have said, what you could have done differently. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. Maybe the timing was cruel. Maybe the world was too heavy on two young hearts. And so, you‚Äôre left staring at your phone, almost typing their name, before remembering that they are no longer yours to reach.\nThe hardest part isn‚Äôt losing them. It‚Äôs learning how to exist without them. Waking up every day and remembering all over again that they are gone. Carrying a love that has nowhere to rest, like water slipping endlessly through your hands. Yet somehow, you keep breathing, you keep walking, you keep living with a heart that is shattered but still beating, broken but still full of hope. Because even after the fire fades, something inside you still aches to believe that beauty will return.\nSometimes, the love we cannot live without is the very love we must learn to survive without. ‚ù§‚Äç?\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

Ajinkya explains how banks pay interest, why sure-shot returns are a red flag, and what role emergency funds and insurance play. He also discusses India versus the US as investment destinations, financial advisory access for salaried individuals, and how to identify scams in the market.\n\nIn the last segment, he breaks down strategies for first-time investors, including where to put money across high, medium, and low-risk options, and shares advice for young professionals who want to double their income by upskilling. The conversation also explores whether a person from a low-income background in India can truly achieve financial independence, and how much wealth is required to achieve it. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Ajinkya Kulkarni Here:\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajinkyamkulkarni/\nX: https://x.com/ajinkyamkul/\n\nFollow Wint Wealth Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wintwealth\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wintwealth\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

    "description": "The survival action series \"Alice in Borderland\" became the most watched Japanese Netflix title by worldwide audiences.\n\nNow, the \"games\" that took the world by storm begin once again.\n\nIn the previous season, Arisu (#KentoYamazaki) and Usagi (#TaoTsuchiya) cleared all of the games and returned to the real world.
