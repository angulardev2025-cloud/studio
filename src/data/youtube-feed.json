Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, “Dude, same!” \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that’s funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you’re laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you’re caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it’s a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends. Think of it as the fun table at the party, sunny, chatty, and just unhinged enough to keep you hooked.\n\n\nFollow us on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/primevideoin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PrimeVideoIN/\nX: https://x.com/PrimeVideoIN\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

    "description": "Prime Video India Presents\nTwo Much With Kajol And Twinkle Official Teaser\nStarring Kajol and Twinkle Khanna\nCreated by Banijay Asia\n\nOfficial Release Date September 25, 2025 on Prime Video India.\n\nAbout:\nKajol and Twinkle are serving up a talk show with a twist - equal parts masti, magic and maybe even some manic energy. Expect wild hot takes, controversial opinions and the kind of honesty that makes you say, “Dude, same!” \nJoining them are their friends who just happen to be some of the biggest stars in the country (and even the world). With eight unique pairs gracing the couch this season, the conversations jump from filmy nostalgia to family drama, love, paparazzi, fame and everything in between.\nWhat sets it apart is the unapologetic female gaze - a perspective that’s funny, sharp, and not afraid to hold up a mirror to society. One moment you’re laughing embarrassingly loudly, the next you’re caught off guard by an insight that might make you question your own life choices. \nBasically, it’s a vibe: two women side-by-side, yapping with their friends. Think of it as the fun table at the party, sunny, chatty, and just unhinged enough to keep you hooked.\n\nFollow us on:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/primevideoin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PrimeVideoIN/\nX: https://x.com/PrimeVideoIN\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.

    "description": "Markets don’t stay the same.\nAt times equities rally, in other phases debt performs better, and during uncertainty, gold or silver take the lead. The challenge? No single asset class works across all market cycles.\n\nThat’s where a multi-asset approach can help. By combining equity, debt, gold, and silver within one portfolio — and adjusting allocations as markets change — investors can aim for better diversification and potentially better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nThe Groww Multi Asset Allocation Fund is built on this very idea. It also uses Groww Mutual Fund’s proprietary platform, SHAASTRA (Strategic Holistic Asset Allocation and Systematic Technical Risk Assessment), which supports fund managers with data-driven insights to make allocation decisions more structured and less prone to human biases.\n\n🗓️ NFO Period: 10th September 2025 – 24th September 2025\n\nExplore : https://groww.in/nfo/groww-multi-asset-allocation-fund-direct-growth\n\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations",

    "description": "First love feels like discovering fire for the very first time. Everything burns brighter, every touch leaves an echo, every word feels sacred. You go to school just to see them smile in the hallway, and suddenly that smile is the most important sight in the world. You stay awake until sunrise because their voice feels better than sleep itself. Every song makes sense, every poem speaks your truth, every star in the sky seems less beautiful than they are. You’d choose them in this universe and in every universe that could ever exist. In their presence, time bends, pain disappears, and forever feels like something you can finally hold in your hands. You think this is it, the kind of love poets spent lifetimes chasing, the kind of love that could never be broken.\nBut then life happens. Distance grows where closeness once lived. Silence floods the places where laughter once echoed. The person who was once your entire world becomes a stranger you still dream about at night. The same memories that once made you smile now burn like open wounds that refuse to heal. You replay conversations in your head, wonder what you could have said, what you could have done differently. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be. Maybe the timing was cruel. Maybe the world was too heavy on two young hearts. And so, you’re left staring at your phone, almost typing their name, before remembering that they are no longer yours to reach.\nThe hardest part isn’t losing them. It’s learning how to exist without them. Waking up every day and remembering all over again that they are gone. Carrying a love that has nowhere to rest, like water slipping endlessly through your hands. Yet somehow, you keep breathing, you keep walking, you keep living with a heart that is shattered but still beating, broken but still full of hope. Because even after the fire fades, something inside you still aches to believe that beauty will return.\nSometimes, the love we cannot live without is the very love we must learn to survive without. ❤‍?\n\nABOUT PRIME VIDEO\nPrime Video is a one-stop entertainment destination offering customers a vast collection of premium programming in one application available across several devices.
