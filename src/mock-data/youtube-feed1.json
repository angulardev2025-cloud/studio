    "description": "This is the CIGA Design Blue Planet 2, and the unboxing experience is unparalleled! The glass itself is a dual curved sapphire crystal with a titanium casing, and there are no hands on this! Inspired by ancient sundials, this watch simulates Earth’s self-rotation, with this intricately detailed globe. This watch is inspired by ancient sundials, and that means, it mimics earth’s self rotation with this extremely detailed globe. Even the back of the watch is transparent, showing the Self-developed automatic movement, with a 40 hour power reserve. it’s just beautiful to watch. \n\nBut how do you tell time on this one? You see this compass, well, this point towards the hour as well as the minute, so this is 12 o’ clock, this it 10:10. Even at night, the watch just looks phenomenal! This one has gotten the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG) award, which brands like Patek Philippe, IWC, or even Audemars Piguet has/have also won.",

It’s **definitely better than Gorilla Glass 3, because just look at our phone now.\n\nThere’s now IP69 rating along with IP68 **and on the inside**, the phone has a bigger 5000mAh battery, but both wired and wireless charging speeds are same as last time.\n\nMotorola has also kept the camera setup same this year with a 50MP main, 13MP UW and a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor but the phone is now powered by Dimensity 7400. It is not really a big upgrade, but we should get some Moto AI features this time.\n\nSusbcribe to @beebomco for more amazing tech videos!",

With years of experience in finance, Ajinkya shares practical insights on how to start investing, what mistakes to avoid, and how ordinary people can build wealth over time.\n\nWe explore questions most people have about money: how much you need before investing, whether to focus on active or passive income, and the differences between FDs, bonds, stocks, gold, and real estate. Ajinkya explains how banks pay interest, why sure-shot returns are a red flag, and what role emergency funds and insurance play. He also discusses India versus the US as investment destinations, financial advisory access for salaried individuals, and how to identify scams in the market.\n\nIn the last segment, he breaks down strategies for first-time investors, including where to put money across high, medium, and low-risk options, and shares advice for young professionals who want to double their income by upskilling. The conversation also explores whether a person from a low-income background in India can truly achieve financial independence, and how much wealth is required to achieve it. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Ajinkya Kulkarni Here:\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajinkyamkulkarni/\nX: https://x.com/ajinkyamkul/\n\nFollow Wint Wealth Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wintwealth\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wintwealth\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

Plus, normal medicines and Glucometer is also down to 5% only.\n\nAnother great change is, Health and Life Insurance now have no GST at all and it also applies to 36 life saving medicines as well as student supplies like pencil, notebooks, maps and more.\n\nThe GST on Gyms, Salons, barber shops and yoga centers will also be 5% only.\n\nLastly, there’s now a 40% slab for luxury and sin items like Luxury Cars, Aerated drinks, and tobacco products.\n\nThese changes will roll out from 22nd Sept, so if you are going to make any big purchases that’ll benefit you, wait till then.\n\nSubscribe to ‪@beebomco  for more such amazing tech videos!",

With years of experience in brain science and healthcare leadership, she explains how our thoughts, habits, and mindset directly shape the way our brain functions and our ability to live a stress-free, successful life.\n\nWe discuss how negative thoughts impact the brain, the daily habits that make it stronger, and what to do when you feel drained, anxious, or overwhelmed. Dr. Adatia shares practical techniques to control anxiety, crying, and emotional breakdowns, while also explaining concepts like neuro manifestation and the differences between men’s and women’s brains in handling stress.\n\nIn the last segment, she sheds light on unique topics like aura photography, how billionaires train their minds differently, and simple ways to rewire the brain for tough tasks. It’s a conversation packed with insights into mental strength and brain health. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Dr Sweta Adatia here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drsweta.adatia\nWebsite: https://www.drswetaadatia.com/\nYoutube: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@drsweta.adatia\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@drsweta.adatiahindi\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business, content creation, & public speaking.
