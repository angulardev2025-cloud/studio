    "description": "Markets don’t stay the same.\nAt times equities rally, in other phases debt performs better, and during uncertainty, gold or silver take the lead. The challenge? No single asset class works across all market cycles.\n\nThat’s where a multi-asset approach can help. By combining equity, debt, gold, and silver within one portfolio — and adjusting allocations as markets change — investors can aim for better diversification and potentially better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nThe Groww Multi Asset Allocation Fund is built on this very idea. It also uses Groww Mutual Fund’s proprietary platform, SHAASTRA (Strategic Holistic Asset Allocation and Systematic Technical Risk Assessment), which supports fund managers with data-driven insights to make allocation decisions more structured and less prone to human biases.\n\n🗓️ NFO Period: 10th September 2025 – 24th September 2025\n\nExplore : https://groww.in/nfo/groww-multi-asset-allocation-fund-direct-growth\n\n\nRA disclaimer link: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations\n\nAbout Groww\n\nGroww is India’s Best Investment App and the Largest Stock Broker.\n\nFind us here:\n\nAndroid app: https://app.groww.in/v3cO/f9o4prne\niOS app - https://app.groww.in/v3cO/tu0yrc3e\nWebsite - https://groww.in/\n\nFor more finance content on stock market, personal finance, investing, watch our top playlists (recommended watch):\n\n👉 Market ki Baat Groww ke Saath: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoYT6T_TrGTTzVUSOEoQDgj\n\n👉 Intelligent Investors: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWp9dK_l7OWnpDM4rj-hn4R-\n\n👉 Groww Alerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWoNd_csoSmqj9CZU8bQ4vMe\n\n👉 IPO Review: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrjL9kwUTxtZsAfuyDWC5R0\n\n👉 Monopolish stocks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrB71iTSxLhpIhkdNWDUau5\n\n👉 Groww Xplained (case studies): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqK3MYZR0oye0jNomKDutyQ\n\n👉 Sector Spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWr-wtvmdmh9M3jAwiDpDu64\n\n👉 Stocks Fundamental Analysis Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWrXnxCtZ_gNIHJvTk9Hu9WQ\n\n👉 Viral Reacts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpfe0kiOwWqWcteDPi8ji7fQ-Cu47Cid\n\nFollow us here on other channels:\n\n🔔 Mutual Funds at Groww - https://bit.ly/3zQpR32\n🔔 Trading with Groww - https://youtube.com/c/TradingwithGroww\n🔔 Groww plus - https://www.youtube.com/c/Growwplus\n🔔 Groww Kannada -  https://bit.ly/3ekyeKP\n🔔 Groww Tamil - https://bit.ly/3cbhN3Z\n🔔 Groww Telugu - https://bit.ly/39aLpwC\n🔔 Groww Malayalam https://bit.ly/3enG2LV\n🔔 Groww Gujarati - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwGujarati\n🔔 Groww Marathi - https://www.youtube.com/@Groww.Marathi\n🔔 Groww Insurance Academy - https://www.youtube.com/@GrowwInsurance\n🔔 Get to Know Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@Gettoknowgroww\n🔔 Ipo review by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@iporeviewbygroww\n🔔 Market ki Baat by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MarketkiBaatbyGroww\n🔔 Money Talks by Groww - https://youtube.com/@MoneytalksbyGroww\n🔔 Thrive by Groww - https://youtube.com/@ThrivebyGroww\n🔔 How they made it by Groww - https://youtube.com/@Howtheymadeitbygroww\n🔔 Share Market by Groww - https://www.youtube.com/@ShareMarketbyGroww\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/growwapp/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_groww\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/groww_official\nLinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/company/groww.in\nTelegram: https://t.me/GrowwHQ\n\nStock market investing content in Hindi | Finance content in Hindi | Personal finance content in Hindi\n\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks, read all the related documents carefully before investing.\n\nIf you have any concerns with respect to Groww, please feel free to write to us at support@groww.in or you can call us at +91 9108800000.\n\nResearch Analyst disclaimer: https://groww.in/p/sebi-research-analyst-regulations",

He began writing for The Economic Times at just 17 and has since built a reputation for his sharp insights on politics, economics, and leadership. In this conversation, he opens up about his journey, his writing career, and the lessons from meeting global leaders including the time he met Vladimir Putin and was later asked to leave Russia.\n\nWe discuss the future of Indian politics, who could be the next Prime Minister, whether the opposition has a real chance, and how power is often misused in politics. Ruchir also shares his thoughts on world leaders like Putin and Trump, what emerging nations can learn from developed economies, and why the freebies culture may be holding India back. \n\nIn the last segment, we dive into India’s growth story, from competition between states and infrastructure spending to unemployment, opportunities for young talent, and lessons we can take from China. Ruchir also explains what needs to change for India to rise as a true global power.\n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nAbout Ruchir Sharma: https://ruchirsharma.com/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

With his expertise in reading human behaviour, he explains how much our gestures, expressions, and even the smallest body cues reveal about us. From spotting hidden emotions to decoding lies, his work bridges psychology and crime investigation in fascinating ways.\n\nWe discuss how professional criminals try to use specific gestures to appear innocent, how microexpressions can expose when someone is hiding the truth, and whether body language can help identify dangerous people, including pedophiles. Gaurav also breaks down the everyday mistakes we make, things as small as avoiding eye contact, crossing arms at the wrong moment, or mismatching words and actions that instantly create dislike and distrust in others. \n\nIn the last segment, he shares the step-by-step process of detecting lies in high-stakes situations, the most difficult cases he’s had to decode, and what serial killers actually feel after their first crime. Gaurav explains the psychology of deception, the science behind spotting danger, and the subtle signals most people miss. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Gaurav Gill Here:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodylanguagewithgauravgill\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-gill-7241bb63/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

Rinku shares the emotions behind his unforgettable 5 sixes innings, how IPL retention changed his family’s life, and his bond with legends like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Rohit Sharma. He also speaks about overcoming language struggles, the risks he took by choosing cricket over stability, and how success impacted his personal relationships.\n\nIn the last segment, Rinku recalls memorable moments with Shahrukh Khan, his growth under mentors like Nitish Rana and Hardik Pandya, and even lighthearted stories like being bitten by a monkey multiple times as a kid. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\nFollow Rinku Singh Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rinkukumar12\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart that explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

Mumbai), an experienced dermatologist and cosmetologist who has worked extensively on skin health, treatments, and anti-aging solutions. She talks about India’s obsession with fairness, explains how dermatologists classify skin shades, and clears myths around tanning, marriage-related pressures, and what “fairness” really means in medical terms.\n\nWe discuss treatments like skin lightening, peeling, micro-needling, and the rising popularity of Korean skincare. Dr. Madhuri shares the real differences between creams, serums, and oils, why certain marketing trends like rice water toners or coffee scrubs aren’t always effective, and how good skincare habits can directly boost self-esteem. She also talks about anti-aging, collagen products, sunscreen myths, and common mistakes people make at different ages.\n\nTowards the end, she discusses trending ingredients like niacinamide and ceramides, how to layer actives safely, and the quick fixes celebrities often use. She also sheds light on future trends such as DNA-based skincare, regenerative medicine, and advanced treatments like mandelic acid. \n\nSubscribe for more such conversations!\n\n\nFollow Dr. Madhuri Agarwal Here:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dr_madhuriagarwal/\n\nFollow Cetaphil Here: \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cetaphil_india/\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/@UCLyDt3WdxLnnzElXQiv2vVw \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/cetaphilskincare/\n\n---------------\n\nAbout Raj Shamani\nRaj Shamani is an Entrepreneur at heart, which explains his expertise in Business Content Creation & Public Speaking.

The body is all-metal, feels super premium, and it’s MIL-STD 810H certified, so you don’t have to worry about small knocks. It’s super light at just 1.74 kg and 1.59 cm thin, making it super easy to carry around in your bag. The real highlight here is the 16” OLED display which is perfect for multitasking, binge-watching, or doing assignments or office work. On the performance side, you get a Snapdragon X chipset with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 512GB Gen4 SSD. In benchmarks, it scores very good and SSD read speeds are close to 6300 MB/s. Gaming is not the best but Battery is crazy good. I got around 19 hours of video playback, and it charges from 0 to 60% in under 50 minutes with the 65W Type-C charger that comes in the box.
